# Chatbot for an APP

Letâ€™s make a chat Bot

Building a chat bot app is done in several steps.

First I need to do a system design of this chat bot to have a clear vision.

Then we can think of the architecture and define a clear infrastructure.

After all of this we can think about implementing it and start coding it. And then maybe deploy it.

the chatbot is intended to be implemented in a cross platform app that i will be developing in collaboration with a friend of mine who will be more on the software side of the proje


Status : 
I'm trying different existing chat bots in the market, and looking at their performances and what they lack. It's always good to know what exists and what can be done in a better way. 

Next steps : 
  - My side : 
    - Starting the design of the architecture of the chat bot.
    - Defining a good infrastructure in relation to the app.
    - Developing the algorithm Maybe as an api so as it can be used easily in our app and other apps as well
